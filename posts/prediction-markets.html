            <p>
                Prediction markets, such as Polymarket and Kalshi, have received <a
                    href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-11-19/fine-trade-labubu-futures">a lot</a>
                of attention recently. One interesting product that is traded on Polymarket binary option on Bitcoin, in
                which you can bet if it will go up or down in some time period:
            </p>

            <p><em>[Image: 15 minute option orderbook]</em></p>

            <p>
                Above is the shortest, and most popular 15 minute option. There seems to be a bug in the volume counter
                shown at the top of the orderbook – volume always goes back to $1.0k when the page is refreshed, and
                then ticks up. These markets typically generate over $100k … [todo]
            </p>

            <p>
                These markets are fairly competitive, with the spread almost always at once cent, the minimum tick size.
                Market Makers have made outsized profits on these markets, with <a
                    href="https://polymarket.com/@Account88888">Account88888</a> previously known as “JaneStreetIndia”
                making $645k USD in just over a month trading only 15 minute markets, and would stand to make more with
                the introduction of maker rebates, although they have seemed to have stopped trading.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, neither Polymarket or Kalshi lets Australians trade. The next best option is the much
                less popular Limitless. For context, Polymarket’s notional volume for the week beginning the 5th of
                January was $1.6bn, about 178 times greater than Limitless’ $9mn.
            </p>

            <p>
                The shortest binary options traded on Limitless are hourly markets. While they have the same expiries as
                Polymarket, they source data differently. Polymarket gets its data from Binance, whereas Limitless gets
                its data from Pyth, which aggregates prices from a range of sources. The difference between Binance and
                Pyth prices tends to be constant, and is often mean reverting, and so can mostly, but not always be
                ignored. The mean reversion comes from the fact that Pyth is just a bit slower at reporting prices – if
                Binance ticks up, it will take a few hundred milliseconds for Pyth to receive this data, and then factor
                it in.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main difference is the mechanism in which these products are traded. All markets on Polymarket (that
                is, BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP) are traded through a central limit order book (CLOB).
            </p>

            <p>
                Only Bitcoin and Solana are offered through a CLOB on Limitless. There only seems to be one market
                maker. Their strategy is fairly rudimentary – they set their midpoint to be that of Polymarket’s, and
                quote 3 cents wide on each side, for a spread of 6 cents. Interesting, a spread of 6 cents is the
                maximum allowed to quality for rewards from the exchange. In the past they used to always quote 100
                contracts of volume on each side. This isn’t the case anymore – perhaps they wish to obfuscate their
                strategy, or someone is queueing up behind the original MM to farm rewards, knowing their quotes are
                very unlikely to get filled.
            </p>

            <p>
                While this seems an attractive market to make, the infrastructure offered by Limitless is quite poor. It
                takes seconds to confirm if one of our orders has been executed, and it is not possible to send a maker
                only order. If we happen to be a taker, then we risk being slugged with a fee up to 3%. While the fee
                curve can be approximated, the exact equation isn’t available in documentation, nor upon request, but
                perhaps can be derived from on-chain data.
            </p>

            <p>
                Anyway, the mechanism on which Ethereum and XRP is traded is more interesting. Limitless uses a constant
                product automated market maker (AMM). This means that token reserves follow the equation x * y = k,
                where x and y are the reserves for yes and no contracts respectively, and k is some constant. Also,
                since yes and no contracts must add up to 1, we have x + y = 1.
            </p>

            <p>
                On Limitless, k = 2500. At the start, there are 50 yes and 50 no shares. Some liquidity provider has put
                up $50, and in return, will receive a cut of trading fees on this market. Currently, fees are 0.1%, as
                most of the cost incurred will be in slippage. Suppose we wish to buy $5 of yes tokens, ignoring fees.
                The AMM will take our $5, and mint 5 yes and 5 no tokens. We only want exposure to the yes tokens, so
                we’ll swap the no remaining no tokens for more yes tokens.
            </p>

            <p>
                As x*y = 2500, and we know that y is 50 + 5 = 55, x must be about 45.45. So, we receive 50 – 45.45 =
                4.55 further yes tokens, brining our share up to 9.55 tokens, having paid an average of 52.3 cents per
                token.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even trading a pithy $5 has resulted in 4.6% slippage. The disadvantage of trading this is obvious – we
                will need a considerable amount of edge to perform a trade of reasonable size. However, any time someone
                trades with reasonable size, we should get an opportunity to knock the price back to its fair value.
            </p>

            <p>
                An interesting decision made by Limitless is that some accounts have a minimum trade size on these
                markets. If you use a custodial account, in which Limitless manages your wallet (and pays gas fees),
                they impose a $3 minimum buy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Anyway, here’s an example of a good trade (that I did not make):
            </p>

            <p><em>[Image: Example of a good trade graph]</em></p>

            <p>
                There’s a bit going on here. First, the blue line. This is the midpoint on the corresponding Polymarket
                market. The yellow line is my attempt at normalizing the Polymarket midpoint. We back out the implied
                volatility under Black-Scholes from Polymarket, and plug it to Limitless. This isn’t great for a couple
                reasons:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>BS isn’t great at pricing these markets.</li>
                <li>As mentioned above, the distance between Pyth and Binance often reverts – you can see this when the
                    yellow line went up to 93 cents, and then crashed back down.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                But, it’s better than nothing. The orange line is the current price of a yes token on Limitless, and the
                bold green and red lines are the average price we would get if we were to buy or sell $1 worth of yes .
                (If we did not have yes to sell, then we can buy no tokens).
            </p>

            <p>
                The faint green and red lines are the average price if we were to buy or sell $3. You might notice that
                the marginal slippage is much higher from selling than buying. The opposite would be true if we were
                trading at, say, 16 cents. Also, dumb-money on Limitless is surprisingly risk-averse – overwhelming
                buying the most likely outcome, in this case yes.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a little annoying for us – as we will likely be net short when Yes is by far the most likely
                outcome. Of course, we will receive a rich payout if it resolves No, but we may go for many hours making
                losses. There are some more considerations to be made:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>If there is a while to expiry, our expected displacement will be reasonably high, we will be able to
                    do some further trades, and so the distribution of our payoff will not be: “lose most of the time,
                    win really big a little of the time”, which may be more convenient.</li>
                <li>If we are close to expiry, and the outcome is highly probably, we are almost certain that a large
                    volume of buy orders will come in. Perhaps we may wish to get in front of them</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Here is the tape for the last few minutes of an Ethereum market:</p>

            <p><em>[Image: Market Tape]</em></p>

            <p>
                Here, delta is a wallets overall exposure to Yes. Wallets with a colour, in this case only 9EC7 are
                those that have traded multiple times in this market. There’s a couple interesting things here:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>7 orders coming in at 7:57:51 of similar size. These wallets have all done about $200 in volume
                    total.</li>
                <li>There exist people buying a contract, which has a maximum value of $1, at a price of $1.02.</li>
                <li>The people who have bought the contract at what is seemingly an unfavourable price each have over
                    $100,000 in volume traded!</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                I’m not sure if this is somehow a profitable trade (I doubt it?), or these traders are farming volume,
                with the goal of receiving an <a
                    href="https://x.com/trylimitless/status/2010773556192239652">airdrop</a>. One can generate a lot of
                volume with just $100. Trading in the few seconds after this market is resolved means that it is
                impossible to lose, and so we only pay fees. Assuming that we pay 10 bps of fees, and 20bps
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately even selling $1 of this contract would result in an average execution price of 99.5 cents.
