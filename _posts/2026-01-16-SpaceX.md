One recent theme in markets is that private companies have been staying [private for longer](https://www.apolloacademy.com/more-companies-staying-private-for-longer/). 

This is an unfournate situation for retail investors:
1. Private comapnies are hot right now! Everyone would love to own some OpenAI.
2. As companies stay private for longer, public market investors miss out on more returns. If OpenAI IPO's for a trillion dollars, how much further can it really grow?

So, there is probably a market in selling exposure to these pre-IPO companies. A few solutions exist, such as Cathy Wood's ARKVX, or through Robinhood's tokenized stock, that is really a SPV. Unfournately, you have to be an accredited investor, or live in Europe. There are a [few](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-12-12/people-really-want-spacex-shares) interesting [trades](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-06-26/anyone-can-sell-you-spacex-stock?cmpid=BBD062625_MONEYSTUFF&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=250626&utm_campaign=moneystuff#footer-ref-footnote-5) that you can do to placate this demand. Unfournately, I can't write naked forwards, or really do anything institutional, so I'll have to look to Crypto. 

A SpaceX IPO is on the cards for this year, so I'll think about trading that. There seem to be a few places I can get exposure:
1. I can trade [perpetual futures](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade/vntl:SPACEX) that resolve to SpaceX's valuation (based on the market close price at the end of the first trading day), in billions. Noteably we don't trade shares, and have no economic ownership of the company, and no exposure post IPO. You can read some documentation [here](https://docs.ventuals.com/perp-specifications/private-companies).
2. I can trade tokens [on Solana](https://prestocks.com/products) that are apparantly fully backed by SPV exposure. 
3. I can buy [binary contracts](https://polymarket.com/event/spacex-ipo-closing-market-cap), such as "SpaceX IPO closing market cap >1T+?", which resolves to $1 if this is true, and $0 otherwise.[^polymarket]

On PreStocks, SpaceX is trading at an implied valuation of $1.21 trillion (as at 12:09 PM, 17/01/2026), despite a "mark valuation" of $971 billion. I suppose this is to be expected?[^expected] People are surely happy to pay a premium for SpaceX exposure. This isn't quite the case on Ventuals, which offers the perpetual futures. SpaceX is trading at a valuation of $977 billion, which is less inflated.

[^polymarket]: Well, not really at the moment. Polymarket is geoblocked from Australia. I mean, with enough effort it would be possible. But, I am telling you about this trade, so clearly it is too much effort (for me, at least).

[^expected]: When asked what keeps PreStocks prices aligned with real-world prices?, PreStocks replies: "Arbitrage. If PreStocks trade above real-world prices, arbitrageurs can buy exposure offchain and mint and sell PreStocks onchain for a profit, increasing supply and lowering the price. If PreStocks trade below real-world prices, arbitrageurs can buy onchain and redeem for the higher offchain value, reducing supply and raising the price. This keeps PreStocks prices aligned with real-world prices." You can also buy a bunch of PreStocks on Solana, and ask to see if they can cash you out. No guarantees, though. Also, you can't live in United States, Canada, Mainland China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macau, India, Japan, Panama, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Ethiopia or in any country subject to US, UK, or EU sanctions.
